      <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and
        structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's
        appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).
        "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between
        websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to
        pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.
        HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML Markup and
        many others.
        An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which
        consist of the element name surrounded by "<" and ">" . The name of an element inside a tag is case insensitive.
          That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the <title> tag can be
          written as <Title>, <TITLE>, or in any other way.
              The articles below can help you learn more about HTML.
      </p>
      <p>HTML describes the structure of a Web page. HTML consists of a series of elements. HTML elements tell the
        browser how to display the content. HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is
        a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.</p>
      <code>
         <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <head>
        <title>Page Title</title>
        </head>
        <body>
        
        <h1>My First Heading</h1>
        <p>My first paragraph.</p>
        
        </body>
        </html>
      </code>

    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Attributes">
      <header id="Attributes">Attributes</header>
      <p>All HTML elements can have attributes
        Attributes provide additional information about elements
        Attributes are always specified in the start tag
        Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"</p>
      <p>There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:

        1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. Example:
        src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".

        Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, you may be in violation
        of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be removed or changed.

        2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain
        name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg".
        If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".</p>
      <code>
          <img src="img_girl.jpg">
        </code>

    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Elements">
      <header id="Elements">Elements</header>
      <p>The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

        <tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>
        Examples of some HTML elements:
        <code>
          <h1>My First Heading</h1>
          <p>My first paragraph.
          </code>
      </p>
      <p>Nested HTML Elements
        HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements).

        All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.

        The following example contains four HTML elements (<html>,

        <body>, <h1> and <p>):</p>
            <h5>Example</h5><br>
            <code>
          <!DOCTYPE html>
          <html>
            <body>
              <h1>My First Heading</h1>
              <p>My first paragraph.</p>
            </body> 
            </html>
        </code>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Miscellaneous">
      <header id="Miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</header>
      <p>The size attribute defines the width of the <input> and the height of the <select> element. For the input, if
          the type attribute is text or password then it's the number of characters. This must be an integer value 0 or
          higher. If no size is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the input has no size declared, and the
          form control will be the default width based on the user agent. If CSS targets the element with properties
          impacting the width, CSS takes precedence. The size attribute has no impact on constraint validation. Examples
          <p>By adding size on some input types, the width of the input can be controlled. Adding size on a select
            changes the height, definining how many options are visible in the closed state.</p>
      </p>
      <code>
          <label for="fruit">Enter a fruit</label> <input type="text" size="15" id="fruit">
          <label for="vegetable">Enter a vegetable</label> <input type="text" id="vegetable">

          <select name="fruits" size="5">
            <option>banana</option>
            <option>cherry</option>
            <option>strawberry</option>
            <option>durian</option>
            <option>blueberry</option>
          </select>
          <select name="vegetables" size="5">
          <option>carrot</option>
          <option>cucumber</option>
          <option>cauliflower</option>
          <option>celery</option>
          <option>collard greens</option>
          </select>

      Inline<br>
      In this article, we'll examine HTML inline-level elements and how they differ from block-level elements. HTML
      (Hypertext Markup Language) elements historically were categorized as either "block-level" elements or
      "inline-level" elements. Since this is a presentational characteristic it is nowadays specified by CSS in the Flow
      Layout. Inline elements are those which only occupy the space bounded by the tags defining the element, instead of
      breaking the flow of the content.
      </p>
      <p>A complete list of deprecated HTML tags and attributes are given here. All the tags have been ordered
        alphabetically along with their equivalent tag or alternate CSS option.</p>
      <code>
      <!-- <center>This text will be centered.
        <p>So will this paragraph.</p></center> -->
