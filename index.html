      <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and
        structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's
        appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).
        "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between
        websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to
        pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.
        HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML Markup and
        many others.
        An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which
        consist of the element name surrounded by "<" and ">" . The name of an element inside a tag is case insensitive.
          That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the <title> tag can be
          written as <Title>, <TITLE>, or in any other way.
              The articles below can help you learn more about HTML.
      </p>
      <p>HTML describes the structure of a Web page. HTML consists of a series of elements. HTML elements tell the
        browser how to display the content. HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is
        a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.</p>
      <code>
         <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <head>
        <title>Page Title</title>
        </head>
        <body>
        
        <h5>My First Heading</h5>
        <p>My first paragraph.</p>
        
        </body>
        </html>
      </code>

    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Attributes">
      <header id="Attributes">Attributes</header>
      <p>All HTML elements can have attributes
        Attributes provide additional information about elements
        Attributes are always specified in the start tag
        Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"</p>
      <p>There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:

        1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website.

        Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, you may be in violation
        of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be removed or changed.

        2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain
        name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg".
        If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain.</p>
      <code>
        </code>

    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Elements">
      <header id="Elements">Elements</header>
      <p>The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

        <tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>
        Examples of some HTML elements:
        <code>
          <h1>My First Heading</h1>
          <p>My first paragraph.
          </code>
      </p>
      <p>Nested HTML Elements
        HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements).
        All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.
        The following example contains four HTML elements</p>
        <code>
        </code>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Miscellaneous">
      <header id="Miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</header>
      <p>
        Applying color
        Attributes
        Attributes.accept
        Attributes.autocomplete
        Attributes.capture
        Attributes.crossorigin
      </p>

        Structuring a page of content ready for laying it out using CSS is a very important skill to master, so in this assessment you'll be tested on your ability to think about how a page might end up looking, and choose appropriate structural semantics to build a layout on top of.
        We all learn to write a letter sooner or later; it is also a useful example to test our text formatting skills. In this assignment, you'll have a letter to mark up as a test for your HTML text formatting skills, as well as hyperlinks and proper use of the HTML head element.
        Writing HTML is fine, but what if something goes wrong, and you can't work out where the error in the code is? This article will introduce you to some tools that can help you find and fix errors in HTML.

      <p>In this article, we'll examine HTML inline-level elements and how they differ from block-level elements. HTML
        (Hypertext Markup Language) elements historically were categorized as either "block-level" elements or
        "inline-level" elements. Since this is a presentational characteristic it is nowadays specified by CSS in the
        Flow
        Layout. Inline elements are those which only occupy the space bounded by the tags defining the element, instead
        of
        breaking the flow of the content.</p>
      <p>A complete list of deprecated HTML tags and attributes are given here. All the tags have been ordered
        alphabetically along with their equivalent tag or alternate CSS option.
        A very common task in HTML is structuring tabular data, and it has a number of elements and attributes for just this purpose. Coupled with a little CSS for styling, HTML makes it easy to display tables of information on the web such as your school lesson plan, the timetable at your local swimming pool, or statistics about your favorite dinosaurs or football team. This module takes you through all you need to know about structuring tabular data using HTML.
        HTML Tables
        A very common task in HTML is structuring tabular data, and it has a number of elements and attributes for just this purpose. Coupled with a little CSS for styling, HTML makes it easy to display tables of information on the web such as your school lesson plan, the timetable at your local swimming pool, or statistics about your favorite dinosaurs or football team. This module takes you through all you need to know about structuring tabular data using HTML.
        In the second article in this module, we look at some more advanced features of HTML tables — such as captions/summaries and grouping your rows into table head, body and footer sections — as well as looking at the accessibility of tables for visually impaired users.
        The head of an HTML document is the part that is not displayed in the web browser when the page is loaded. It contains information such as the page <title>, links to CSS (if you choose to style your HTML content with CSS), links to custom favicons, and other metadata (data about the HTML, such as the author, and important keywords that describe the document). Web browsers use information contained in the head to render the HTML document correctly. In this article we'll cover all of the above and more, in order to give you a good basis for working with markup.
